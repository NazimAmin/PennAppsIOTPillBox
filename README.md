## PennAppsIOTPillBox

An Intel Edison powered internet connected smart pillbox with a web interface that keeps track of patientâ€™s medicine, send alerts to the loved ones, and order, and deliver pills when needed. 

**Won Honorable Mention at PennApps Winter 2015!**

## Motivation

There are always those people who forgets to take pill. Those who take wrong pill on wrong days. And those who run out of pill when they strictly need it. *This is to solve that problem.*
